           Predator prey interactions across scales
        </h2>
        <p></p>
        <p> Species interactions are are one of the most basic components of biology. All species must make a living by either outcompeting, predating or parasitising other species. These interactions in turn make up the astoundingly complex ecosytems that make up our world.
        </p>
       
        <p>Despite the obvious importance of understanding these interactions, the incredible range and complexity underpinning these processes make general predictions hard to pin down. However, within ecology research, approaches have emerged which allow us to make such general predictions based on fundamental aspects of biology such as body size, energy use through metabolic rate and environmental complexity.
          I am interested in using a variety of approaches to better understand these general patterns with a focus on how intraspecific interactions relate to body size and environmental complexity.
          </p>

          My research to data has focused on how animals obtain or avoid becoming food through fundamental process and includes studies on the evolution of venom in snakes, scavenging ability in theropods, life history traits in birds and mammals, temporal information processing abilities across species and how predator-interactions fit into ecosystem stability.

The evolution of venom production in snakes
</h2>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
Of all the creatures that can instil innate fear snakes seem to hold <br /> 
<img src="images/venom2.png" align="right" height="450"/> 
a prominent place amongst our worst nightmares. Such fear is probably justified as snakes produce some of the most deadly compounds in the natural world. The Inland Taipan for example contains enough venom within its glands to kill approximately 11 thons of mice or about 50 adult humans. On the other hand most snakes are not particularly venomous or in fact produce none at all. 
<p></p>
Understanding why some species seem to produce extremely toxic venom or venom at all is likely down to its primary role as a tool to capture prey. However despite the evolutionary novelty of venom and snakes importance as major predators within ecosystems little is understood about this variance. 
<p></p>
To better understand the evolution of this trait I am currently running a large comparative analysis of ecological and physiological traits associated with venom production.

Scavenging in theropod dinosaurs
</h2>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 The enormous size and diversity of forms of Theropod dinosaurs raise many questions of how they survived in a world that bears little comparison to today’s ecosystems. In particular I am interested in what foraging behaviours they must have performed to meet their enormous energetic demands. One strategy theropods may have utilised is facultative scavenging.

In particular I am interested in what foraging behaviours they must have performed to meet their enormous energetic demands. One strategy theropods may have utilised is facultative scavenging.
<p></p>
This part of my research uses published estimates of theropod attributes and agent-based modelling approach’s to replicate theropods foraging in a range of potential possible environments. My research in this area has to date shown that facultative scavenging behaviours not only provide a significant resource in Mesozoic environments but, contrary to current thinking, such scavenging is most efficient at intermediate body sizes of around half a ton.These results mean that larger adult forms of Tyrannosaurus rex and its relatives were certainly not scavengers and more likely to have relied on active predation while other species such as Dilophosaurs and juvenile Tyrannosaurs were likely to have been effective scavengers, much like modern hyenas.
<p></p>
This modelling approach using an energetics-modelling approach at the level of the individual can allow a window into Earth’s ancient ecosystems, giving us a better understanding of the behaviour of some of the most enigmatic and iconic species of the Mesozoic.

Life history evolution and extrinsic mortality
</h2>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
Lifespan is one of the most fundamental traits of a species.  <br /> 
<img src="images/longevity no background.png" align="right" height="300"/> 
Large animals such as whales can live for centuries while smaller animals such as rodents are lucky to live through the year. For example naked mole rates and many species of bats manage to live for over 27 and 40 years, far longer then expected for their size.
<p></p>
My research in life history evolution focuses on the role of predation on life history strategy. In particular I am interested in the role of predation as a source of extrinsic mortality that can act a selection force for shorter lifespans and higher fecundity. 
<p></p>
To date this research has shown that species that can fly, or are arboreal have longer lifespans then expected when controlled for body size. I am currently still researching the role of species capability to build protective burrows and nests on lifespan evolution.

Ecology and evolution of temporal information processing
</h2>
 <p></p>
 <center>
<img src="images/eyepic.png" align="" height="250"/> 
<p></p>
The world isn’t always what it seems. The uniform yellow of a flower to us is a complex patterned landing strip to a soon to be pollinator bee and the passing blur of such a bee is seen as clear trajectory to some of its waiting predators.
How animals perceive motion and in a sense time is a fundamental way we processing the environment in which we live. Although time may seem continues it is more like a series of still pictures taken over the duration of an event. Such still images are costly for brains and other sensory systems to capture and process leading to species taking an economic view of seeing the world. 

<p></p>
My research is interested in understanding when an animal should invest or reduce the ability to see the world at different speeds. In particular I am interested in understanding the role of body size and metabolic rate on Critical Flicker fusion, a measure of temporal information processing similar to camera shutter speed, across species.
<p></p>
So far we have used comparative methods to show that small animals with high metabolic rates see time the fastest however we are currently working on using neural networks to better understand the evolution of this trade of and the situations where it does not apply.

Ecological stability
</h2>
<center>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
The stability of ecological systems is infamously difficult to predict despite being the bedrock of theoretical ecology for several decades. One of the reasons for the difficulty in predicting such systems is their complex nature and the challenges associated in measuring and testing them. However in the last decade computational techniques and power has allowed for more exploration of the fundamental components that affect the stability and structure of complex ecosystems.
<center>
<img src="images/stability.png" align="center" height="300"/> 
<p></p>
My research in this area involves collaborating with numerous researches in the filed in particular around the area of how multiply types of stability interact with one in other to give an overall system its dynamic behaviour. Future work will look at the individual role of species towards this overall stability and how different body size distributions of predators and their prey may change how these systems function and persist.
